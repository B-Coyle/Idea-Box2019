<h3>Brief Overview of the Project</h3>
<p>The purpose of this project is to continue stretching our coding muscles- mastering the html, css, and javascript functions as well as implementing DOM and localStorage into the mix. We've created one html file and two javascript files (idea and main) with different ways to affect our Javascript. The goal was to create a application that accepting user input and create a new card with their ideas (title, body, quality) and allow the user to update the idea directly and have it save on reload. </p>
